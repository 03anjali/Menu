## Java program to create a menubar and add MenuItems to it.

## ` MenuBar using Java`
- Class MenuBar

A menu bar handles keyboard shortcuts for menu items, passing them along to its child menus. Keyboard shortcuts, which are optional, provide the user with an alternative to the mouse for invoking a menu item and the action that is associated with it. 

Each menu item can maintain an instance of MenuShortcut. The MenuBar class defines several methods, shortcuts() and getShortcutMenuItem(java.awt.MenuShortcut) that retrieve information about the shortcuts a given menu bar is managing.

## `Packages used`

The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, classes, subpackages and exceptions.
## AWT Package
The Abstract Window Toolkit ( AWT ) package in java enables programmers to create graphical user interface applications. It contains a number of classes that help to implement common windows-based tasks, such as manipulating windows, adding scroll bars, buttons, list items, text boxes, etc. All the classes are contained in the java.awt package.

All these classes are hierarchically arranged inside the AWT package in such a manner that each successive level in the hierarchy adds certain attributes to the GUI application.
